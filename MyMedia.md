My favorite movie is Star Wars: A New Hope. 
My parents started me out on the older star wars movies even though the new ones were coming out as I was growing up. 
It was one of the first movies that I remember watching and I loved getting introduced to all the characters.

This table is going to be giving you some recommendations.
You will get a title of a book, song, or video, a little description on why I recommend it, and the creator of the media.

| Name | Description | Creator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low | It is a very good song. It's R&B so if you are needing to wind down it can really help. | SZA |
| Star Wars | The star wars movies are a great way to spend free time. They take you on a journey with an amazing story. | George Lucas | 
| Creed | The Creed movies show you a lot about working hard and are a great set of motivational movies. It can help inspire you to maybe start working out if you don't or just be more involved in anything you are interested in. | Ryan Coogler |
| Diamonds | There is a really good beat to the song and Frank Ocean is an amazing vocalist so the song sounds really nice. | Frank Ocean |
